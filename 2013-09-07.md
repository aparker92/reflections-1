I think the thing that has been the most challenging for me is knowing what all of the software we are installing is supposed to look like on our computers and when to use each thing. I've been getting better at this just by exposure and by asking people sitting near my in class. I wish that at the beginning of the week I had done more tutorials on how to use everything instead of just following the instructions without any context involved.
For example, my repository that I made in class called "Reflections" was broken and I spent an hour last night attempting to create a new file, though there was no button like all of the things on google said there would be. Today I deleted that repository and created a new one, but because I'm in the marching band, I have been busy all day and haven't had a chance to work on it again until this evening - after the 5:00pm deadline (I also didn't know that the deadline was 5, I thought it was just the end of the day).
Looking back on this week, I think that the biggest thing I would have done differently is understood the context and what each program would do before. I had an "Aha" moment when we ran the virtual machine because I previously had not thought about what it was going to be used for. I am very excited about this class because everything seems so interesting and exciting.
